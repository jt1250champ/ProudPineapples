## Our Vision
ProudPineapples allows people to compete with their friends online, answering questions about social change. In the midst of having fun, our purpose is to create greater awareness of our communities and the communities around us. The 1-on-1 playing style is intentional so that people can learn together and initiate conversations regarding social change to potentially take action. 

Our game utilizes a Javascript interface, powered by Python and Flask. User data is stored in a SQLite 3 database.
